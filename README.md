generic history game is a minimalistic trivia game about history by me. that's all.

## game functionality
there are three difficulties (as of now): easy, medium, and hard. each difficulty boasts 10 questions. if you get a question wrong, the game will continue to progress. your score equates to how many questions you got right.
