<h3 align="center">minimalistic trivia game by me</h3>

## game functionality
there are three difficulties (as of now): easy, medium, and hard. each difficulty boasts 10 questions. if you get a question wrong, the game will continue to progress. your score equates to how many questions you got right.

if any of these questions are wrong (i apologize if so), open up an issue and i will correct accordingly.
